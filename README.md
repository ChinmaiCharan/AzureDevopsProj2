# Overview

This is my submission for the 'Building a CI/CD Pipeline' project as part of the 'DevOps Engineer for Microsoft Azure' nanodegree program from Udacity.

This project contains a python application that is designed to predict housing prices in Boston (I did not create the python app myself). This repo will enable you to:

Deploy the app in Azure CloudShell
Deploy the app as an Azure App Service
Any commits to the GitHub repo trigger automated code testing using GitHub Actions. A pipeline has been created in Azure DevOps, and the updated code is also automatically tested in Azure DevOps and deployed to the Azure App Service.

## Project Plan
<TODO: Project Plan

* A link to a Trello board for the project
* A link to a spreadsheet that includes the original and final project plan>

## Instructions
* Architectural Diagram

Instructions for running the Python project.  

* Project cloned into Azure Cloud Shell

  Open Azure Cloud Shell, create a SSH key pair by running the command : ssh-keygen -t rsa;
  
  Copy the public SSH key generated using command : (e.g., the file ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub);
  ![rsa_pub](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95535252/147278056-bd402a95-9d3e-473d-ad57-5f2e0ecf9f5d.JPG)
  
  Add the SSH key on to the GitHub

  Run git clone git@github.com:ChinmaiCharan/AzureDecopsProj2.git to clone the repository into Azure Cloud Shell:

  Create and activate the virtual environment:

  source ~/.udacity-devops/bin/activate
  Install dependencies in the virtual environment and run tests:

  make all  

  ![make all](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95535252/147281007-8838ba0d-d489-463e-843f-6bb145ed7285.jpg)

  Start the application in the local environment:
  
  python app.py
  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95535252/147283414-c9ce9507-08e0-4355-b098-8c0ab2829ed4.png)
  
   Open a separate Cloud Shell and test that the app is working:

./make_prediction.sh
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95535252/147283768-97bb0c4b-4179-4dfd-8c4a-18023f1b47e4.png)

Create GitHub Action
![Github Action](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95535252/147286406-35e15490-df9b-4989-a251-0db900d8a7bd.JPG)

* Project running on Azure App Service
Create an App Service in Azure.


Our App Service is called proj2cicd and the resource group is called proj2rg:

az webapp up -n proj2cicd -g proj2rg

webapp infrastructure is created and verify the frontend:

* Passing tests that are displayed after running the `make all` command from the `Makefile`

* Output of a test run

* Successful deploy of the project in Azure Pipelines.  (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/ecosystems/python-webapp?view=azure-devops).

Next, create the pipeline in Azure DevOps. More information on this process can be found here. The basic steps to set up the pipeline are:

Go to https://dev.azure.com and sign in.
Create a new private project.
Under Project Settings create a new service connection to Azure Resource Manager, scoped to your subscription and resource group

Create a new pipeline linked to your GitHub repo.

To test the app running in Azure App Service, edit line 28 of the make_predict_azure_app.sh script with the DNS name of your app. Then run the script:

./make_predict_azure_app.sh

Load testing
We can use locust to do a load test against our application. In this example we will do a load test against the app running locally rather than in Azure.

Install locust:

pip install locust
Ensure the app is running:

python app.py
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95535252/147288676-86b6c02d-786f-4178-8044-e205fdb41361.png)

Start locust:

locust
Open a browser and go to http://localhost:8089. Enter the total number of users to simulate, spawn rate, set the host to localhost:5000, and click Start Swarming:
